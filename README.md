# Quantum Stenography with BB84 Protocol

This project implements quantum key distribution (QKD) using the BB84 protocol. It includes an interactive application for creating quantum circuits based on the number of qubits selected and provides a detailed overview of the encoding and decoding processes.

## Introduction

Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that implements a cryptographic protocol involving components of quantum mechanics. The BB84 protocol, proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, is one of the first and most well-known quantum cryptographic protocols.

This project demonstrates how the BB84 protocol can be used to securely share keys between two parties, Alice and Bob, and hide secret messages within cover messages using quantum properties.

## Features

- *BB84 Protocol Implementation*: Securely distribute keys using quantum mechanics.
- *Interactive Circuit Design*: Create quantum circuits based on a user-selected number of qubits.
- *Embedding and Extraction Procedures*: Encode and decode secret messages using quantum states.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- Qiskit
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-stenography.git
cd quantum-stenography
Usage
To run the sender (Alice) script:

bash
Copy code
python sender.py
To run the receiver (Bob) script:

bash
Copy code
python receiver.py
Ensure that both the sender and receiver scripts are executed in the same environment to facilitate the quantum key distribution.

Files
quantum_stenography.py: Main script for the quantum stenography implementation.
sender.py: Script for the sender (Alice) to encode and send the message.
receiver.py: Script for the receiver (Bob) to decode the received message.

Implementation Details
The encoder circuit is based on 7 qubits but our interactive application has an option to create circuits based on the number of qubits selected and view them instantaneously.

Here are some steps to interactively play with our application:

Choose the number of qubits using the slider. We would suggest that you choose 7 for the encoding and decoding scheme to work flawlessly. You can also test out other number of qubits to view the generated circuit.
